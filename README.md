Procedurally-generated cloud textures with Perlin noise. Screenshots don't really do justice to the animations.

The application requires SFML and places the texture generation on a separate thread from the render loop.

This project originally appeared on my GitHub page with the title "SFML-Gimmicks," but I realized I was sharing a texture ripped from a popular monster fighting game for handheld consoles. All of the assets now available are my own and yours to take and modify.
